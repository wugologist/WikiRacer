# WikiRacer
AI agent to play the Wikipedia Game

Final project for CS 4100 Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University

This is a project to find a series of Wikipedia pages linking one to another in as few page loads as possible (not necessarily the shortest path). It uses an A* search and a variety of different heuristics are being tested. It will eventually have more advanced heuristics utilizing NLP and other classification methods.
